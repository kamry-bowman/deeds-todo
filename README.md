# Deeds Todo

This was a todo app built to explore a few technologies, mainly React Native, and GraphQL. The project features the following tech stack:

- React Native (Expo)
- Apollo Client
- AWS Cognito Authentication
- Graphql Yoga
- Prisma Graphql Application Layer
- Heroku Postgresql Data Layer
- Mocha/Chai server testing

Designs were made by me in Figma.

The app was tested for Android only but has been built in Android and iOS. A known limitation of the iOS version is that time picking functionality is not implemented.

The app can be viewed via en emulator [here](https://expo.io/@kamdugle/deeds-todo).
